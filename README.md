# Service-Time-Counting-from-Video-Data
=======================================

## Description:
I have an input video. I have counted the times when a customer taking service from a shop-keeper. Additionally, I have counted the number of customer taking services. 

I have used Yolo model to detect human in a specific position where the customer have to stay stand still during service offered by the shop-keeper. Based on that theory I have counted times in second the the number humans.
